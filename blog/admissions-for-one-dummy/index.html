If this post doesn‚Äôt resonate with you, that‚Äôs fine. This is about my ignorance and how I found &quot;success&quot; in both the admissions process and law school. In no small way, it&#x27;s a function of my privilege that I landed at a prestigious place like Harvard Law School despite that ignorance. </p><p>That said, I grew up on a small family farm in rural Nebraska, went to high school with 46 of my closest friends, and had never met anyone that had gone anywhere but the two local law schools. I say that to detail the root (ha, farm joke) of my ignorance, but also in the hope that somebody reading this might have a similar background and feel validated in both their pursuit of law school and their confusion. My success had always stemmed (ha, farm joke) from having a community that supported me, and I sorely lacked that as I started to pursue law school.</p><p>As I prepped for my first LSAT, I stumbled on the LSAT prep subreddit, and from there I found r/lawschooladmissions. At first, it was so overwhelming it almost made me give up the idea of going to law school altogether. The jargon, the timelines and deadlines, admissions strategies, everything was so foreign to me that I just about shut my laptop and didn‚Äôt look again, writing off the whole process. It took about a day of perusing the subreddit to see that not only did I not know a bunch of stuff about the process, but I didn‚Äôt even know what I didn‚Äôt know. </p><div class="admonition admonition-tip alert alert--success"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="12" height="16" viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>The admissions process is an incredibly confusing game that‚Äôs mostly unknowable. You‚Äôll be happy to know that law school is the same.</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"></div></div><p>My ignorance, literally a day before blissful, was now terrifying. ‚ÄúTake the LSAT and go to law school‚Äù wasn‚Äôt much of a plan, I found out. Honestly, the reason I stayed on the subreddit was because there was a healthy dose of memes and more than a few people talking about how dumb they felt. As I relied more and more heavily on a random reddit page I‚Äôd stumbled across for high-level admissions advising, it started to feel like maybe the admissions process isn‚Äôt meant to be easily understood. Two years of being at law school, and I know that has to be the case. The admissions process is an incredibly confusing game that‚Äôs mostly unknowable. You‚Äôll be happy to know that law school is the same.</p><p>From day 1 on campus, it became apparent yet again that I didn‚Äôt know anything about the place I was at or what law school really was. I didn‚Äôt know where the cafeteria was. Honest to God, I didn‚Äôt know there was a cafeteria. I stumbled across it in the 2nd week of classes when like, half my classmates were up there eating lunch. I had classmates that knew the best professors, the best way to study, how decisions in a circuit were binding on district courts (I found out what district and circuit courts were). Invariably, these classmates had someone in their circle that had done this before, been to this school, or were just so smart they knew how to figure it all out (go read Riley‚Äôs post to see how a smart person would tackle these problems). I, on the other hand, am stupid. I got to law school because I found an internet community that took in a dummy and gave him the tools, guidance, and encouragement necessary to succeed. </p><div class="admonition admonition-tip alert alert--success"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="12" height="16" viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>What has made you successful so far in your life will translate to law school.</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"></div></div><p>After 2 years of law school, I‚Äôm still stupid. That said, what has made you successful so far in your life will translate to law school. You don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel in law school. I‚Äôve only ever ‚Äúsucceeded‚Äù when I felt like I had a community of people that cared about and invested in me, because I wanted to validate that investment. I navigated the admissions process by finding a community. I‚Äôve navigated nearly 2 years of law school by trying to do the same thing. I don‚Äôt know if it has ‚Äúworked‚Äù but I know I have classmates who(m?) I care about and that care about me. I know by having that community I don‚Äôt outright hate law school, and I honestly think I might‚Äôve even learned like 3 or 4 things. If finding community is how you succeed, do that. If it‚Äôs something else, do that.</p><p>Committing to any life-changing event is stressful, and choosing a law school is no exception. I urge you NOT to pick a school based solely on (1) where you‚Äôre accepted first, (2) the school‚Äôs rank, or (3) because you feel like you ‚Äúshould.‚Äù Of course you want to attend the best school possible, but it&#x27;s critical to ensure that school is a financial, emotional, and logical fit. So take a deep breath and enjoy each acceptance before diving into those hard questions!</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/glen">glen</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/advice-corner">advice corner</a></div></footer></article><div></div><div class="margin-vert--xl"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/advice-corner-choosing-a-law-school"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Advice Corner: Choosing a law school ¬ª</div></a></div></nav></div></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_2xL- thin-scrollbar"></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright ¬© 2022 LSData.</div></div></div></footer></div>
