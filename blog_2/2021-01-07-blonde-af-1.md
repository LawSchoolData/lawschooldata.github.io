Applying to law school is exhausting.  Applications are long, expensive, and give you anxiety like you’ve never felt before.  This week I’ll discuss key points for each component of a  law school application - fees, transcripts, LSAT scores, letters of recommendation, resumes, statements of intent, diversity statements, and addendums.

Like I said, they’re LONG.
### STARTING OUT

I have good news and bad news right off the bat.

The good news: most, if not all, law schools only accept apps submitted through the Law School Application Center, LSAC for short.  LSAC is kind of like the law school version of the undergrad Common App - you simply make an account on https://www.lsac.org/, start uploading documents, and choose where to apply.  Simple!

The bad news hits quick though - creating an LSAC account costs $195.  Technically you’re paying for the “Credential Assembly Service” (CAS), which generates a Law School Report for each application.  The CAS includes a transcript summarization, creation of individual law school reports (which includes an academic summary report, LSAT scores, transcripts, admission index (?), and anything else the school requires),  letter of rec processing, and electronic application processing.  After you’ve filled out your personal information and uploaded the documents one time, the CAS automatically generates that info for all applications.
