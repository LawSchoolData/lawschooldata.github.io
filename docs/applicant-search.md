[The applicant search](https://www.lawschooldata.org/search) allows you to search for applicants that meet certain criteria, e.g. [KJD](terminology#kjd) applicants with a GPA between 3.0-3.3 and an LSAT between 160-162.

The table shows the number of matching applicants that applied to each school, along with acceptance and rejection rates. Clicking on the school name shows the actual applicant results and profiles.
