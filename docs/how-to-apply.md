## I have decided I want to go to law school. Where do I start?
Great to hear. The LSData graphs and these FAQ are a great place to start. Overall, it kind of depends on what you currently have going on.

* **Undergraduate**: Best thing you can do is get good grades. If you don’t have good grades, it’s not the end of the world. You might have to take a little more time off before law school, and you might have to study hard for the LSAT, but you can get into great law schools with bad grades.
* **Working professional (5+ years)**: Prepare your recommendation letters. Law schools tend to prefer 1 professional, 1 academic, but 2 professional letters are fine if you've been out of school for many years. Focus on quality of your relationship with your recommenders rather than their credentials, i.e. don't ask for a rec letter from the senator that you met once at a dinner party. Craft a compelling narrative for *Why law?*
