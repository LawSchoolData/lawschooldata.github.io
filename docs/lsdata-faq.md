### How much money is $$$, exactly? What does it mean when people say that they received a scholarship of $$?
Each $ is equivalent to 25% tuition (excludes [CoL](terminology#col)). 
* $ = 25% scholarship
* $$ = 50% scholarship
* $$$ = 75% scholarship
* $$$$ = full ride
* $$$$+ = full ride + stipend ([Yes, these exist.](terminology#ruby))

### What do the tiers of softs mean?
The soft tiers that LSData uses are based off of a [comment made by /u/whistleridge](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/660o4h/classifying_softs_and_clarifying_what_is_and_is) from reddit. 

:::caution
The soft tiers are **NOT** to be taken super seriously. Softs are inherently unquantifiable. The tiers are **very** rough guidelines for putting a number on something that really can't be quantified. Don't take the tiers too seriously when comparing yourself to other applicants on LSData. Holistically valuing softs is the admissions comittee's job.

### Where do you get all this data from?
Most data on LSData is user reported. Some information is pulled from [ABA 509 reports](terminology#aba-509-report).

##### Do you vet or verify the data?
Generally speaking, no. The system runs on good faith and the belief that there is little incentive to lie when your data is semi-anonymized and aggregated. Obvious errors such as reporting decision dates in the future, or an acceptance to YLS with a 120 LSAT are sometimes fixed.

### Why am I not receiving my verification/password reset email?
If you have a @yahoo.com or @aol.com email address, you aren't receiving LSData emails because their flawed spam detection has identified LSData as a spammer and is blocking all emails from LSData. Please send an email to lawchecker0@gmail.com to get your account manually verified.
