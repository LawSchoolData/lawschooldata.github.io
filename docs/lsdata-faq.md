### Where do you get all this data from?
Most data on LSData is user reported. Some information is pulled from [ABA 509 reports](terminology#aba-509-report).

### Do you vet or verify the data?
Generally speaking, no. The system runs on good faith and the belief that there is little incentive to lie when your data is semi-anonymized and aggregated. Obvious errors such as reporting decision dates in the future, or an acceptance to YLS with a 120 LSAT are sometimes fixed.

### Why am I not receiving my verification/password reset email?
If you have a @yahoo.com or @aol.com email address, you aren't receiving LSData emails because their flawed spam detection has identified LSData as a spammer and is blocking all emails from LSData. Please send an email to lawchecker0@gmail.com to get your account manually verified.
