title: Automated status checker
---

Automatically checks all of your app statuses with the tap of a button. Saves you the effort of manually logging in to 20 different status checker websites.

## Status checker activation

You can enable a status checker through [My statuses](https://www.lawschooldata.org/statuses) > [Add a school](https://www.lawschooldata.org/statuses/new) > Enable automatic status checker. You need a confirmed email to use the automated status checker.

### Last checked vs. Last status change

**Last checked** is the time when LSData last checked your status.

**Last status change** is the time when your status changed from what LSData previously recorded. This will turn red if a change is detected. Some schools update their statuses daily. Others only update statuses with substantial changes (e.g. UR -> Decision).

### Before/after comparison

LSData saves your current app status and you app status from the last time that you checked so that you can easily compare changes in your app status.

### Collapsed statuses

School statuses are collapsed by default but will automatically expand when a status change is detected.

## 20 minute cooldown

LSData will only check your statuses when you tap the button, with a maximum of once every 20 minutes. If you tap the button before 20 minutes has elapsed since your last refresh, nothing will happen.

## Can schools see that LSData checked my status?

TL;DR - Yes, it's possible but unlikely. For a longer answer, [see here](lsdata-faq#can-schools-see-that-lsdata-checked-my-status).
