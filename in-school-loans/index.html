Why would I consider private loans?<a class="hash-link" href="#my-school-says-i-should-just-take-out-federal-student-loans-why-would-i-consider-private-loans" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Federal loans have great perks, like being able to take advantage of programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) (link), Income Based Repayment (IBR), and Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) (link), and there is a chance that some of all of them could be forgiven in the future depending on about 12,000 political factors.</p><p>Since public loans have these perks, private loans should only be considered if you can’t qualify for federal loans, or if you can save money from private loans by getting better terms. If you want to check out some private lenders and compare rates you can check out our calculator here (link) that will let you compare options.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="what-is-an-origination-fee"></a>What is an origination fee?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-an-origination-fee" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>If your loan has an origination fee then you will receive less money than you borrow. If you have a 4% origination fee, then you will get 96% of whatever you borrow. Borrow $10k, you will receive $9,600, and interest will accrue on the full $10k.</p><blockquote><p>“An origination fee is a percentage of your loan amount charged by the lender for the processing of your loan. Federal student loans have an origination fee; therefore, the amount you may receive as a disbursement may be slightly lower than the amount you accept.” - studentaid.gov</p></blockquote><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-loans-i-am-applying-for-have-application-fees-is-that-normal"></a>The loans I am applying for have application fees, is that normal?<a class="hash-link" href="#the-loans-i-am-applying-for-have-application-fees-is-that-normal" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In short, no; You should reconsider the lender if they are charging application fees. You can find a list of lenders that don’t have fees here (link). </p><p>If you are in a credit position where you can’t qualify for all of the federal or private loans (from more reputable lenders) that you need to attend school, then we recommend reaching out to your university for guidance.   </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="i-am-not-a-us-citizen-or-permanent-resident-but-i-still-need-to-borrow-for-school-what-can-i-do"></a>I am not a US citizen or permanent resident but I still need to borrow for school.

You can check out our lender comparison table here (link) to see which ones. </p><p>Frankly, you are in a tougher spot when it comes to borrowing than others. </p><p>If you have someone who is a US citizen/resident who will cosign on your loan, then you can borrow with most private lenders (and all of our highlighted lenders). </p><p>If you do not have someone who can cosign, then we recommend these four options: </p><ol><li>Reach out to your university, or the international student’s club. This will be a great place to get some school specific information. </li><li>Look for borrowing options in your home country that will cover US education. </li><li>Check out US-based lenders that cater to international students. You can see two on our lender comparison page (link). Keep in mind that these lenders know that you are in a hard spot (and people occasionally stop paying their loans and leave the country) so they have higher fees and interest rates than those for US citizens.</li><li>Find a lender who will give you a personal loan (vs a student loan) and pay the school directly. A hard thing here is that you will have to start making full monthly payments immediately after you get the money. </li></ol><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="do-i-have-to-pay-my-law-school-loans-while-i-clerk"></a>Do I have to pay my law school loans while I clerk?<a class="hash-link" href="#do-i-have-to-pay-my-law-school-loans-while-i-clerk" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>For federal loans you can switch to an income based repayment plan while you Clerk to reduce your payment. On this plan you only have to pay a fixed percentage of your disposable income. You can learn more about IBR, at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven</a></p><p>As of right now, only a few private lenders offer a guarantee of full deferral while you Clerk, and those only offer it for 12 months so you will have to start payments if you do more than one. However, some private lenders might be willing to work with individuals on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>Keep in mind that anytime you defer your loans (or make payments lower than you your minimum monthly payment), you will be accruing more interest than you would otherwise and the total price you pay for your loans will be higher than if you made consistent payments.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="what-does-idr-income-driven-repayment-mean"></a>What does IDR (income driven repayment) mean?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-does-idr-income-driven-repayment-mean" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>These are federal programs that allow you to pay a certain amount on student loans each month based on how much you make.

If you borrow with a private lender or refinance with a private lender, this option is no longer an option. </p><p>PSLF is an amazing program and it is vital that you understand the program if you have federal loans. One major challenge is that there are quite a few requirements you have to meet in order to take advantage of the program. We are a small operation and keeping all the requirements up to date would be tough, so we recommend checking out the above link to learn more.  </p><p>A quick summary of things that are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. In order to use PSLF, you have to qualify for an income driven repayment plan and you have to work for a qualifying employer and you have to do both of these (and other stuff) for 120 payments (at least 10 years). </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="so-when-should-you-consider-pslf-as-you-plan"></a>So when should you consider PSLF as you plan?<a class="hash-link" href="#so-when-should-you-consider-pslf-as-you-plan" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><div class="admonition admonition-caution alert alert--warning"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>caution</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>We are not giving legal, financial, or tax advice.

Therefore, one time you should definitely consider PSLF, is if you are deciding between being employed by a ‘qualified employer’ and a non-’qualified employer.’ In this scenario, your choice of employer may be the only thing that keeps you from using PSLF and you should take that fact into consideration. </p><p>A brief piece of unsolicited advice: It is important to plan for the long term when considering IDRs and PSLF. If you are deciding between a ‘qualified employer’ and a non-’qualified employer’ then you should project out your future earnings across all 120 payments, and not just what you will be making the first year. This is a long way of saying that your future earning from a non-’qualified employer’ might be higher than a ‘qualified employer’ AKA raises might be bigger with private companies vs public companies. This is written with love from someone who worked for the federal government for 10 years.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="what-is-a-loan-repayment-assistance-program-lrap-and-does-my-school-have-one"></a>What is a Loan Repayment Assistance Program (LRAP), and does my school have one?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-loan-repayment-assistance-program-lrap-and-does-my-school-have-one" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Note: these programs are sometimes called LIPP or Low Income Protection Program.</p><p>Loan Repayment Assistance Program, or LRAP, are university sponsored (paid for) programs where Universities help their students pay for loans.
